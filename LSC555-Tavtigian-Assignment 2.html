 <h2>Analysis of the <a href="https://cuatower.com/" target="_blank">website</a> using the usability framework</h2>

            <td>Search query based on key word in article title. There is no way to filter the results. Results show in reverse chronological order.</td>

    <h2>Critique of the site:</h2>
    <p>I think the CUA Tower page is simple and basic in design. The site does not have many features besides showing the published articles. The users are continuously informed with what is going on with the site and how the user got to that page, however, there is not much to do besides view articles. Users can choose which topic of the news they would like to see on the header that is visible from all pages. The site design feels natural and intuitive. It feels consistent with other newspaper sites. The language used is easy to understand and minimal. Users are not required to learn anything new when visit the site. When a user navigates away from the main page, there is a small log created towards the top of the page showing the user how they got there. Users can click the tab to go back to where they came from. There is no Undo or Redo option, but it is not needed. If a user clicks a hyperlink within an article and is taken to a new page, they must use their browser back button to get back to The Tower. The hyperlink does not open in a new tab. When it comes to searching through archival articles, the site is rigid and does not allow the user much flexibility.</p> 

	<p2>If a student was doing research on alcohol use on campus and wanted to search The Tower for relevant material, they would have some difficulty. The search feature is only searching for articles with the terms “alcohol” and “use.” There is no way for the student to filter by year. Additionally, the student cannot change the order in which results are presented, for example relevance, popularity, or date of publication. There is no indication on the site that the article metadate are tagged with key words. Only two articles appeared related to the student’s search. The ‘More Stories’ tab at the end of the article does not show articles that are similar in content, only the most recently published stories. This will hinder the student from seeing other stories with correlated material.</p2>

	<p>The CUA Tower has been in publication since 1922, but the archives on this site only go back to 2015.</p>
    <h2>Strengths:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplistic Design</li>
        <li>Functionality of the site</li>
        <li>Consistency of material throughout</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Weaknesses:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lack of refinement in searching</li>
        <li>Lack of association between related article topics and issues.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Mini Usability Test Results</h2>
    <p>I think there are many similarities between the heuristic analysis completed and the mini-usability test that was done with the help of my friend Jordan. Jordan noted the same strengths and weaknesses of The Tower’s site as I did. While he did not spend as much time as I did on the site, he was able to quickly identify some key areas of improvement. The first thing he noticed when attempting the mini-usability test was the inability to perform an advanced search. After searching for the key words, “Vietnam” and “World War II,” Jordan realized that the archives only went back to 2015 making it unlikely that he would find anything related to the school’s changing attitudes on the subjects. The limited user interface is simple and easy to use to read articles, but limited in its capacities. </p>
