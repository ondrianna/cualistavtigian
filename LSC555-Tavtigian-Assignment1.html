    <h1>Smithsonian Digital Libraries</h1>

    <h2>Context:</h2>
    <p>The Smithsonian Institution was established after James Smithson left over half a million dollars to the United States to promote education and knowledge. Twenty years after his death in 1846, Congress created the Institution by establishing a Board of Regents and building a museum. Today, there are 21 branches of museums and research centers.</p>
    <p>The Smithsonian’s goal is to increase accessibility. The Smithsonian Digital Library allows people all over the world to access online books, digital collections, exhibitions, and research tools. The libraries and museums preserve the culutral heritage of the nation, while promoting new academic study.</p>

    <h2>Users:</h2>
    <p>The main users of the Smithsonian Libraries are Smithsonian researchers, curators, and staff, along with scholars and the public. There are no fees or costs with accessing any of the Smithsonian resources making it open to everyone.</p>

    <h2>Content:</h2>
    <p>On the digital library website, the collections can be <a href="https://library.si.edu/collections" target="_blank">found here</a>. Users can view collections, links to the online catalog, and helpful tips. Once inside a collection, users have access to the cataloged data of items. The main search page can be found <a href="https://collections.si.edu/search/index.htm" target="_blank">at this link</a>.</p>
    <p>Each item record will include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Artist</li>
        <li>Author</li>
        <li>Subject</li>
        <li>Physical Description</li>
        <li>Type</li>
        <li>Place</li>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Topic</li>
        <li>Data Source</li>
        <li>EDAN-URL</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Physical Collections:</h2>
    <p>There are approximately 1.5 million books and manuscripts, 400,000 pieces of ephemera, microfilm, and photo collections, located in 21 locations around the Metro DC area and throughout the United States.</p>
    
    <h2>Digital Collections:</h2>
    <p>Of the electronic and digitized content, there are 35,000 digitized books and manuscripts, 18.3 million records of museum objects, archives, and library materials, and 8.1 million online images, audio, videos, and blog posts. The digital collections are continously improving with the helpful of dedicated professionals and volunteers who donate their time to translation and transcription services.</p>

    <h2>Unique & Interesting Features:</h2>
    <p>The Smithsonian Digital Library is user-friendly, filled with millions of electronic records, and always growing. The website has a lot more resources compared to a regular public library catalog, thanks to its large funding. There are around 30,000 human remains within the collection. The oldest artifacts are billions of years old.</p>

    <h2>Pros:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the world’s biggest collections of knowledge for specialized fields.</li>
        <li>No library account is needed to access materials. There are no associated fees.</li>
        <li>The search feature has nine different filters for better results.</li>
        <li>Users can create lists and view their history.</li>
        <li>Patrons can request to see some materials in person through interlibrary loans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cons:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Not all records have pictures, which can make identification harder.</li>
        <li>The large number of records can be overwhelming for people not familiar with technology.</li>
        <li>Most content is valuable mainly for researchers and academics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Suggestions for Improvement:</h2>
    <p>The website could be made more accessible for younger students and children. While it is great for adults and researchers, it may be difficult for beginners to use without prior experience. The site is best suited for adults who know what they are looking for. Being a graduate student who has worked in libraries, I know how to navigate the site easily, but I do not think that all people would share that same sentiment.</p>
